# EODC PyGeoApi

This user documentation provides an overview of using the [PyGeoApi deployment](https://features.services.eodc.eu/) at EODC in order to access public and private collections of vector datasets that are available.

## What is PyGeoApi?

### Overview

PyGeoApi is an open-source Python project that implements OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) API standards for serving geospatial data over the web. It allows users to publish, access, and interact with geospatial data through modern web-based APIs. pygeoapi supports a variety of geospatial formats and data sources, making it easier to deliver geospatial services and applications for developers and organizations involved in geographic information systems (GIS).

### Might be appropriate for you?

1. **Need for Open Standards Compliance**: PyGeoApi is built to comply with OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) standards, ensuring that your geospatial data can be accessed and shared seamlessly with other systems and applications worldwide. By using pygeoapi, you're assured of delivering data in a way that's universally compatible and future-proof.

2. **Flexibility in Data Sources and Formats**: Whether you're managing simple or complex geospatial datasets, pygeoapi supports a wide variety of formats like GeoJSON, NetCDF, and GeoTIFF. This flexibility allows you to serve your data from various sources while maintaining high performance and accessibility, ensuring that your customers get the most out of your geospatial assets.

3. **Customizable, Secure, and Scalable**: Our deployment supports both public and private geospatial collections. Private collections can be securely protected behind token-based authentication, giving you control over who can access sensitive data. This ensures that your information is both protected and accessible only to authorized users, while allowing public collections to be shared more broadly. Whether you need to integrate with existing systems or scale up as your operations grow, pygeoapi provides the tools and extensibility to support your evolving requirements.
