# ACube - Austrian Data Cube

The Austrian Data Cube (ACube) is a service offering to consume a number of different geospatial data collections. The service offering focuses on analysis and visualisation of data by providing various APIs and client software. The first version of the ACube was tailored around the open data cube (ODC) ecosystem. Recently, a new version of the Acube service offering was released, responding to lessons learned and adopting to state of the art technologies.

Acube is now built around the STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog) specifications, with a particular focus on the STAC API for data discovery. To simplify user access, the data is made publicly available via HTTPS and S3. This combination of data discovery and access APIs of the ACube lowers the barriers to geospatial data use, making it easier for users to explore, analyze, and turn data into knowledge.
