# Adding a new process to the openEO processing dask

## Overview 

EODC's openEO backend can be extended with community processes. This documentation explains the steps you need to follow if you want to add your own process. There is also an [official guide](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes-dask/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the [openEO-processes-dask github](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes-dask).

## 1. Example Process

The process by which the procedure is described is a process to detect deep moist convection. Deep moist convection (DC) is associated with dangerous weather phenomena such as torrential rain, flash floods, large hail and tornadoes. The release of latent heat inside deep convective clouds often plays a crucial role. Studies have shown that DC and overshooting cloud tops penetrate into the lowest stratosphere and enable the exchange of gases from the troposphere deep into the stratosphere. The Sentinel satellites offer the possibility to monitor DC around the globe, independent of the emissivity of the ground. Detecting Deep Moist Convection (DDMC) is a combination of Deep Moist Convection, low- and mid-level cloudiness.
The template for the process comes from Stavros Dafis and can be found on [sentinelhub](https://custom-scripts.sentinel-hub.com/custom-scripts/sentinel-2/deep_moist_convection/).


## 2. Preparation

To add your own process to openeo, three different files must be prepared. One is the .py file with the process, one .py file with tests and the other is a .json file with all the information about the process.


### Python process file

With the Python file for the process, it is important that it really only contains the relevant code and no tests or other implementations. The process should also be written in one function if possible. Apart from the function, the file should contain all the required (openeo) libraries and small labels or explanations of the procedure.
You find examples for python scripts in the [openEO-processes-dask github](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes-dask/tree/main/openeo_processes_dask).

To add the process to the list of processes, you need to add your process to the `openeo_processes_dask/process_implementations/__init__.py` file.

All example files for DDMC can be found at the bottom of this document. 

### Python test file

The process must be sufficiently tested before it can be integrated into the production system. A test file must therefore be created. All possible errors and problems must be tested here using abstract data. Possible problems are incorrect input or coding errors, for example.

### JSON file

So that others can find and use the new process, it must be described in a JSON file. Information about the use case and the input and output of the process is recorded here. Examples can also be found in a [github repository](https://github.com/eodcgmbh/openeo-processes).


## 3. Pushing the process into the openEO processes dask

First you need to create a fork of both GitHub repositories, [openeo-processes-dask](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-processes-dask) and [openeo-processes](https://github.com/eodcgmbh/openeo-processes/tree/master).

The repositories can then be cloned to the local system.
`git clone https://github.com/<YOUR USER NAME>/openeo-processes-dask.git`

With `poetry install --all-extras`, all versions of libraries currently used on openEO can be downloaded.
If you want to add a new dependency run: `poetry add some_new_dependency`

All changes must be committed and pushed into a new branch of your openeo-processes-dask fork. Then a pull request can be created to merge the fork into the openeo/openeo-processes-dask. 
However, the following points should be noted beforehand:
- Add comments and documentation for your code
- Make sure your tests still run through and add additional tests
- Format your code nicely automatically after every commit - `run poetry run pre-commit install` and `pre-commit run --all-files` once, then it'll work for every commit 
- Add a descriptive comment to your commit and push your code to your openeo-processes-dask fork
- Create a PR with a descriptive title for your changes

To add the .json file to eodcgmbh/openeo-processes, you need to push your file into a branch in your fork and create a pull request.

After you requested a pull request, you need to wait for an approval from one of the repository-maintainers. They either approve your pull request or request changes.

## 4. Example code

The .py process file for ddmc looks like this:

```

        LOWCL = B11 - B10

        LOWCL_result = LOWCL * gain

        return LOWCL_result

    # midcl = reduce_dimension(data, reducer=MIDCL, dimension=dimension)
    midcl = MIDCL(data)
    midcl = add_dimension(midcl, name=target_band, label="midcl", type=dimension)

    # dc = reduce_dimension(data, reducer=DC, dimension=dimension)
    dc = DC(data)
    # dc = add_dimension(dc, target_band, "dc")
    dc = add_dimension(dc, target_band, label="dc", type=dimension)

    # lowcl = reduce_dimension(data, reducer=LOWCL, dimension=dimension)
    lowcl = LOWCL(data)
    lowcl = add_dimension(lowcl, target_band, label="lowcl", type=dimension)

    # ddmc = merge_cubes(merge_cubes(midcl, dc), lowcl)
    ddmc1 = merge_cubes(midcl, lowcl)
    ddmc1.openeo.add_dim_type(name=target_band, type=dimension)
    ddmc = merge_cubes(dc, ddmc1, overlap_resolver=target_band)

    # return a datacube
    return ddmc
